## üöÄ Welcome to CIIE_Remote_Labs Project Repository

This guide will walk you through the **first steps** to start contributing to this project. Even if it's your **first time using GitLab or Git**, don't worry ‚Äî we've got you covered.

---

## üìå Prerequisites

- A **GitLab** account ‚Üí https://gitlab.com  
- **Git** installed ‚Üí https://git-scm.com/downloads  
- Terminal access on your machine

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Set up your SSH key and link it to GitLab
An SSH Key is a secure authentication method used to connect to Git servers without using a password.

1. Generate a new SSH key:
        Go to your Terminal and execute:
```bash
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
        Then press Enter to  accept the default file location.

2. Start the SSH agent and add your key:
```bash
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

3. Copy the following output, this will be your public key:
 ```bash
    cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```
4. Go to gitlab -> Preferences -> SSH key
5. Paste the key, give it a name and click on **add key**

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Fork the Repository
**Why Fork a repository?**
Forking creates your own copy of the repository under your GitLab account, allowing you to freely make changes without affecting the original project. It‚Äôs the starting point for contributing in a safe and isolated way.

                1. Go to the main repo on GitLab.
                2. Click "Fork" (top-right).
                3. Choose your namespace (usually your account).

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Forked Repo
**Why Clone a repository?**
Cloning the repo to your local machine lets you work offline and use tools like a code editor and terminal. It gives you a full copy of the codebase where you can build, test, and commit changes locally before pushing them back to GitLab.

                1. Go to your forked repository and click on **code**
                2. Copy the SSH code
                3.  In your terminal,go to the directory where you want to have your repo and run:
  ```bash
    git clone {{ssh}}
```      
                4. You can now access your cloned repo as to any folder in your computer, using cd.
## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Create a New Branch for Each Edit
**Why do we always have to create a new branch?**
Working on separate branches for each task:
        - Keeps the main branch clean and stable
        - Helps organize changes by purpose
        - Makes it easier to review, test, and revert individual features
        - Prevents conflicts when multiple people are working in parallel
        - Each branch becomes a self-contained unit of work.
To create a new branch, go to your terminal and run:
  ```bash
    git checkout -b myNewBranch
```  
Note that when you create a new branch, it copies the one you are currently on.
## CONGRATULATIONS, YOU ARE NOW READY TO START WORKING

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Make Commits and Push Your Code
After each small, meaningful change to your code, you should be making a commit.
``` bash
git add .
git commit -m "Explain clearly what was changed"
git push origin your-branch-name
```
## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Merge Request (MR)
Once you've pushed your branch:
        1. Go to GitLab ‚Üí click "Create merge request"
        2. Fill in:
                A clear title
                A descriptive message (what changed & why it needed to be changed, some context on the new feature , how to test, Demos, images, anything)
        3. Assign at least one reviewer
        4. Do not merge without approval
If approved, you (the author) must do the merge
üõë Even if you‚Äôre the reviewer on someone else‚Äôs MR, don‚Äôt merge their code.

## Good practices for Merge Requests (MRs)
‚úÖ One clear goal per MR
Don‚Äôt mix unrelated changes ‚Äî one MR = one purpose.

‚úÖ Small, frequent commits
Make it easier to track and revert if needed.

‚úÖ Descriptive commit messages
Write messages that explain the what and why, e.g.:
Fix: prevent crash when username is missing

‚úÖ Write a clear MR description
Explain what you did, why it matters, and any context needed for the reviewer.

‚úÖ Assign a reviewer
Always assign someone to review before merging. Never self-merge without review.

‚úÖ Let the author merge
Even if you reviewed it, the person who created the MR should be the one merging it ‚Äî this avoids confusion and maintains responsibility.

‚úÖ Keep discussion respectful and constructive
Reviews are a collaborative process ‚Äî we're all working toward the same goal. üí¨ü§ù
